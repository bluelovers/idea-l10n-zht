Reports unresolved file paths in ignore directives within Go module files.

<p>
  This inspection helps identify paths specified in ignore directives that cannot be resolved to actual files or directories in the module.
  It only validates paths that are relative to the module root (starting with "./"), as other paths may exist at various depths in the module hierarchy and cannot be reliably resolved.
</p>

<p>
  The ignore directive causes the go command to ignore specified directory paths and any files or directories recursively contained within them.
