An entity within a Spring Data JDBC aggregate is referencing another entity that already belongs to a different aggregate.
In Spring Data JDBC, every reference to another entity must remain strictly within the boundaries of the same aggregate.
Cross-aggregate relationships cannot be expressed as direct entity references;
they should instead be modeled using the identifier of the target aggregate
(for example, storing the foreign key as a simple value type).
